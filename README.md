#PheroTrap

IoT-Based Smart Trap for Brown Planthopper Control

PheroTrap is an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart pest control system designed to monitor and control brown planthopper (wereng) infestations in rice fields. The system integrates pheromone-based attraction technology, smart sensors, and microcontrollers to automatically detect, count, and log pest activity in real time.

This project provides an eco-friendly and data-driven alternative to chemical pesticides by enabling early detection and accurate population monitoring, helping farmers make better pest management decisions.
