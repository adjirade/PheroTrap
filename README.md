# PheroTrap
🐛 PheroTrap – IoT-Based Smart Trap for Brown Planthopper Control

PheroTrap is an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart pest control system designed to monitor and control brown planthopper (wereng) infestations in rice fields. The system uses pheromone-based attraction technology combined with smart sensors and microcontrollers to automatically detect, count, and record pest activity in real time.

This project aims to provide an eco-friendly, data-driven alternative to chemical pesticides by enabling early detection and precise population monitoring.
